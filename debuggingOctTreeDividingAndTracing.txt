things that are strange about the oct tree dividing planes

rays that hit faces of the cube don't have through node plane intersection points

previous points on the cube move with the camera (don't stay fixed in the world) when
the camera is moved

	lowering the rays per frame reveals 
	
		that rays that hit the faces of the cube do
		have intersection points they are simply obscured and by the textured face intersection
		points because there are more of them
	
		also the through node points that appeared to be on the face of the cube are
		actually on a horizontal plane but were being replaced when the camera moved
		when the number of rays per frame were high

fixed debugging plane colors

found that first axis divided is y (because the root node is x )

this == parent.MaxNode //this is the depth 1 y top node
this.minCoord = [ -10000,     1, -10000 ]
this.maxCoord = [  10000, 10000,  10000 ]

objects[0].AABB.minCoord = [ 1, -1,  -1] //right side
objects[0].AABB.maxCoord = [ 1,  1,   1]

objects[1].AABB.minCoord = [ -1, -1, -1] //bottom
objects[1].AABB.maxCoord = [  1, -1,  1]

objects[2].AABB.minCoord = [ -1,  1, -1] //top
objects[2].AABB.maxCoord = [  1,  1,  1]


nextTraceNode == this.parent.minNode //level 1 bottom node

nextTraceNode.minCoord = [ -10000, -10000, -10000 ]
nextTraceNode.MaxCoord = [  10000,      1,  10000 ]

n.objects[0].AABB.minCoord = [ -1, -1, -1 ] //back
n.objects[0].AABB.maxCoord = [  1,  1, -1 ]

n.objects[1].AABB.minCoord = [ -1, -1,  1 ] //front
n.objects[1].AABB.maxCoord = [  1,  1,  1 ]

n.objects[2].AABB.minCoord = [ -1, -1, -1 ] //left side
n.objects[2].AABB.maxCoord = [ -1,  1,  1 ]



dividing when objects are added
1 object can cause a large amount of shuffing of nodes during division
overlaps not checked from both sides (though should be ok b/c sorted)
found objectDictionary uuid's not set for faces in quadmesh oct tree for check if checked last node

when loading complex scenes, the computer is locking up, probably because the tree
is dividing excessively using all avaliable ram

need to prevent dividing if having a balance ratio of less than a certian amount
and rebalance the tree if not well divided
