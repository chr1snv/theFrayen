//idea for denoising the sparse number of samples that can be obtained when
//compute time is limited in realtime raytracing

//an image composed of spectral components
//when rendering or sampling given an estimate of how many sample points will be
//avaliable to render the frame, returns a list of where next to sample that
//will cause the greatest waveform energy change in the image
//in practice though sampling so that cache coherance is maintained 
//(grouping the computation of similar rays) may need to be weighted
//against minimal selection of rays

//because the complexity is number of x weights * y weights * height * width
//need to consider using a heirarachy maybe only use 5 weights per level

//also converts it's spectral representation to a bitmap image given requested
//width and height

  //most examples seem to have f(x,y) = coef(u,v) * cos((2x+1)/n * u * pi) * cos((2y+1)/n * v * pi)
  //think the 2 is from 2pi and /n is to map the x and y's into 0-1 so the cosine is computed from 0 - u or 0 - v

  //0th order is sum of all the pixel values
  //1st order is sum of samples convolved (weighted multipy) by the 1 hz x and y cosine wave

  //invert the cosine transform
