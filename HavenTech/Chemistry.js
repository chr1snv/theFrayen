//non detailed (macro scale approximate) chemical equation solver for simulating and explaining
// chemical interactions of objects at temperatures


//electron charge, orbitals, bonding energy, 
//light/rf absorbance, reflectance, emittance, transmittance etc

//thermal mass - conductance, emittance, reflectivity

//material phase - solid, liquid, gas, plasma (based on pressure and temperature, ideal gas law pv=nrt)

//analysis
//ph measurment (acidic -h)1-7(neutral), 8-14(basic +oh)
//mr, ir, rgb, uv, xrf spectrum analyzer , ionic charge/z spectrometer
//obtianed spectrum hints at chemical structure / formula of substance

//filtering/separation
//density air/liquid flow separation at temperature
//macro/molecular filter screen
//static/ionic reactant to attach and detach from compound/element

//storage
//inert confinment (solid/liquid)container/(gas)vessle (pressure limits)
//magnetic containment

//synthesis / polymerization
//electro, thermal/rf/kinetic reactor, catalyst / enzyme / nucliation site interaction promotors
