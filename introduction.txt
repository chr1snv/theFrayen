premise - outline / player hook for the frayen

<feeling triggering existential fear, freedom, joyfullness simultaniously>
(the overhauser effect)

<narrator>
normal life is amazing, and were happy to be able to share this moment with you
but naturally you are looking for more
your whole life you have been running, trying to fit in
afraid of what reprecussions your actions have [scenes of poverty, jail, national conflict]
trying to find your place amongst others with the same fears [boss, parents, leaders telling you what to do]
because making moves without understanding them has oppertunity cost [get excited , ends in yelling, disaster]

<nieve character>
the truth is that everyone, and you are gods [morph between scenes of present day and imagination]
and capable of anything [briefly show fantasy existance, and extreme hardship, also low poly and high res]

<narrator>you have thought that reality and imagination were seperate things[drawings on a page, pixel graphics]
<personable character> I'm here to tell you they aren't
>you are imagination, and imagination is reality
>that is to say everything you have been looking for is not outside your reach
>you already have it and you are made of it

the only question is in an existance without bounds what choices will you make

>theFrayen



fps game intro

wether your fighting viruses, learning new techniques, entering into battle
giving a speach, sorting information
a common skill that is required is having good aim ( a clear purpose and determiniation )


intensity, curosity
on call, on scene,
immediacy
gen mag
venstar
flovana


how does spacetime obfsucate information

if reality exists on carrier waves, then an object in different temporal spatial
locations is 'riding' different waves so though the wave of the object is present
it is convolved with that of its surrounding location


life is like the fortnite bus, a river though space and time, it continues ever
forward, with the mainflow out of your control though small parts locally modifiable
by transistor like cascade actions (butterfly effect)


consider mental state as a like a key to reading vibrations of the universe
the waves given off by chemical interactions and energy 
depending on mental oscilations or state, different interactions with the universe
will occur


the power of intention

and the danger? of over amplification
is there a point where socital interaction breaks down when systems and
expectations are over stressed? yes
the enemy is always bad form/structure
i.e. a single ruler / over authoritarian/dictator form of rule

the rules/laws of the universe (navier stokes, maxwells equations, etc)
dictate the forms that perform better than others
and the effect echoes/propigates from microscopic to larger scales and longer interaction times




character - you are sabrina (slender black hair )
engineered to be the most attractive, seductive, and deadly girl in existance
designed by a group of anarchist scientists whos goal is only to make
something beautiful consequences be dammed.
you have free will, the soul of a champion and access to means beyond 
what most can dream of



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_control_network
"
After a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground, the map is then said to be "in control". Having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly. 
"
Without knowlege, an internal system to organize data that ones senses give them
in daily life, one has no reference point or metric to make decisions based on.
That is the difference between those that haven't played the frayen and those that
have. have you gained reference?


in human life finding a path to success is always desired
at first glance one would think that mastering logic and the laws of the universe
would suffice, but there is more to the story
understanding oneself and others becomes key
humans are creatures, subject to the laws of the universe like everything else
and tuned for self survival
fight, fuck, steal, lie, cheat, deceve are all part of a humans base programming
if one learns something, the first thoughts of how to use it will be how to aid in ones survival

when interacting with another human, to establish a successful relationship
that benfits both equally
it is important to not trigger any of the base programming of the other and
make sure that the base needs of that human are met before asking anything of them
first ensure the other feels safe and and don't boast or show off (or it will be
interpreted as a challenge and met with aggression)
