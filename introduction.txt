premise - outline / player hook for the frayen

<feeling triggering existential fear, freedom, joyfullness simultaniously>
(the overhauser effect)

<narrator>
normal life is amazing, and were happy to be able to share this moment with you
but naturally you are looking for more
your whole life you have been running, trying to fit in
afraid of what reprecussions your actions have [scenes of poverty, jail, national conflict]
trying to find your place amongst others with the same fears [boss, parents, leaders telling you what to do]
because making moves without understanding them has oppertunity cost [get excited , ends in yelling, disaster]

<nieve character>
the truth is that everyone, and you are gods [morph between scenes of present day and imagination]
and capable of anything [briefly show fantasy existance, and extreme hardship, also low poly and high res]

<narrator>you have thought that reality and imagination were seperate things[drawings on a page, pixel graphics]
<personable character> I'm here to tell you they aren't
>you are imagination, and imagination is reality
>that is to say everything you have been looking for is not outside your reach
>you already have it and you are made of it

the only question is in an existance without bounds what choices will you make

>theFrayen
