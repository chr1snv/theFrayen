premise - outline / player hook for the frayen

<feeling triggering existential fear, freedom, joyfullness simultaniously>
(the overhauser effect)

<narrator>
normal life is amazing, and were happy to be able to share this moment with you
but naturally you are looking for more
your whole life you have been running, trying to fit in
afraid of what reprecussions your actions have [scenes of poverty, jail, national conflict]
trying to find your place amongst others with the same fears [boss, parents, leaders telling you what to do]
because making moves without understanding them has oppertunity cost [get excited , ends in yelling, disaster]

when asked to join/joining a company/group/event/gathering/conversation what is being asked is if you want to join a shared dream.
a interaction with rules/interaction parameters defined by the group
what all beings in life try to do is defeat entropy, the natural tendancy of local gradients towards the average state or arrangment of the universe

<nieve character>
the truth is that everyone, and you are gods [morph between scenes of present day and imagination]
and capable of anything [briefly show fantasy existance, and extreme hardship, also low poly and high res]
it is only awareness of what that means that differs between individuals

<narrator>you have thought that reality and imagination were seperate things[drawings on a page, pixel graphics]
<personable character> I'm here to tell you they aren't
>you are imagination, and imagination is reality
>that is to say everything you have been looking for is not outside your reach
>you already have it and you are made of it
	(physical locations, goods, consumption in excess and reliance or desire for acceptance from others is not where
	creation of new value begins, the path to happyness and success begins with introspection of the inner ecosystem
	of the self)

the only question is in an existance without defined bounds what choices will you make
(there of course are some bounds, for without defining them yourself there is only entropy-everything and nothingness)
(the game also will have some definitions/bounds so players can relate to it and the portion of reality it occupies can be defined (energy requirement and complexity size))

fps story driven game intro

wether your fighting viruses, learning new techniques, entering into battle
giving a speach, sorting information
a common skill that is required is having good aim or intention ( a clear purpose and determiniation )
having a well chosen intention (something that is realistic (in line with the enviroment of a stiuation)
not asking for too much, or too little) ensures a good chance of success and benificial carry over into
subsequent situations

how does spacetime obfsucate information

if reality exists on carrier waves, then an object in different temporal spatial
locations is 'riding' different waves so though the wave of the object is present,
it is 'convolved' (multiplied with, interacts) with that of its surrounding location


from the vantage point of an outside observer in a seperate timeline or universe a person's life
 is an expierence like riding a tram through a themepark or a person on a guided tour, 
a river though space and time, it continues ever forward, 
with the mainflow out of your control though small parts are locally modifiable
by transistor like cascade actions (butterfly effect)


consider mental state as a like a key to reading vibrations of the universe
the waves given off by chemical interactions and energy 
depending on mental oscilations or state, different interactions with the universe
will occur


the power of intention

and the danger? of over amplification
is there a point where socital interaction breaks down when systems and
expectations are over stressed? yes
the enemy is always bad form/structure
i.e. a single ruler / over authoritarian/dictator form of rule
and micro interactions / assertions of dominance between people
(when someone speaks louder than another to win an debate or argument, it's
only a sort term win and doesn't address the underlying logical/organizational problem
that may again reappear)

the rules/laws of the universe (navier stokes, maxwells equations, signal proceessing algorithms, etc)
dictate the forms that perform better than others
and the effect echoes/propigates from microscopic to larger scales and longer interaction times



character - you are sabrina ( slender black hair vixen )
engineered to be the most attractive, seductive, alluring and powerful human in existance
designed by a group of borderline anarchist/mad scientists who are rebelling against the status quo
by using their knowledge and passion of organinc logic engineering to create someone/something beautiful
as a testiment to their own existance and to benefit the earth's standing in the universe,
consequences (judgmental/emotional outcries against it from others and peers) be dammed.
You have free will, and a soul/ethos (core ideals) based on morals based on the knowledge that
the only way to ensure success for everyone is to do things as well as possible
and uphold structures and codes of conduct that benefit the whole of society and the enviroment.
Otherwise corruption will creep in and luxury life with access to means beyond what most can dream of will fade.
Afterall the average state of the universe does not contain life or a society of dreams
and from history and the law of diffusion 
(when a gradient or disparity of anything exists in reality, between hot and cold, order and disorder, rich and poor, etc)
socities that benefit those in it can only be maintained if as a whole the individuals in the society trend towards maintaining and improving it.
If actions aren't improving a situation, then it's probably because either there's not enough energy or understanding on your side
so leaving it is important as the best course of action (prime directive from star trek (don't interfere in the development or affairs
of non threatening / lesser developed civilizations) )


---Ok, so theFrayen is yet another super hero game, why would anyone want to play it?---
Because of its slightly different take, with some new characters and settings
made with an in web browser client side based game engine that can be played on mobile or high end pc vr hardware.
Also being free/ad revenue driven with paid story sections and items
the player base can potentially be everyone 14+ and interaction durations can vary from 5 minutes to hours to attract /
be acessible to as many players as possible.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_control_network
"
After a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground, the map is then said to be "in control". Having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly. 
"
Without knowlege, an internal system to organize data that ones senses give them
in daily life, one has no reference point or metric to make decisions based on.
That is the difference between those that haven't played the frayen and those that
have. have you gained reference? (possible solgan for advertising the frayen)


---Concepts for the plot evolution and dialog interactions---

In human life finding a path to success is always desired
at first glance one would think that mastering logic and the laws of the universe
would suffice, but there is more to the story
understanding oneself and others becomes key
humans are creatures, subject to the laws of the universe like everything else
and tuned for self survival
fight, f#&*, steal, lie, cheat, deceve are all part of a humans base programming
if one learns something, the first thoughts of how to use it will be how to aid in ones survival

when interacting with another human, to establish a successful relationship
that benfits both equally
it is important to be mindful of the base programming of the other and
be sure it is appeased (the law of the jungle comes first)
(make sure that the base needs of that human are met) before asking anything of them
>first ensure the other feels safe and and don't boast or show off unless first certian
it will be recieved favorably (because if it makes the other feel uncertian or worried it 
will be interpreted as a challenge and met with aggression)

It's also important to keep in mind that everyone views the world from their
point of view, that person will prefer to interact in ways that they are familar
with and seek lines of questioning and reasoning that adhear to their world view


When talking with ebay support (FeeBay), they focused on how I was feeling and how my
day was going and "were glad they could put a smile on my face"....
They did not fully resolve the issue though, they are still charging exorbinant
fees and appear to be unable to act profesonally. They also said
"im sure you will soon be a great seller on eBayb"
reading about the fact that ebay has a court case against them for harassing
sellers and that the guy who "bought" the airconditioner has gone to prision
for stockpiling and selling narcotics, eBay has become like joker from the
Batman series. Criminals who have become mentally insane and have lost touch
with reality, precieving reality as a series of twisted jokes.
